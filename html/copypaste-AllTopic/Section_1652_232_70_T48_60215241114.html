</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Payments (JAN 2000)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) OPM will pay to the Carrier, in full settlement of its obligations under this contract, subject to adjustment for error or fraud, the subscription charges received for the plan by the Employees Health Benefits Fund (hereinafter called the Fund) less the amounts set aside by OPM for the Contingency Reserve and for the administrative expenses of OPM, amounts for obligations due pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause and the performance adjustment described at 1615.404-4, plus any payments made by OPM from the Contingency Reserve.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) OPM will notify the Carrier of amounts due for outstanding obligations under the contract. Not later than 60 days after the date of written notice from OPM, the Carrier shall reimburse OPM. If payment is not received within the prescribed time frame, OPM shall withhold the amount due from the subscription charges owed the Carrier under paragraph (a) of this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The specific subscription rates, charges, allowances and limitations applicable to the contract are set forth in Appendix B.
