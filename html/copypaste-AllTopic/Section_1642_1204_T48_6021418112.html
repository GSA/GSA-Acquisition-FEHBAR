</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTS:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Government, represented by various Contracting Officers of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), has entered into Contract Number ____ with the Transferor. The term <em class="ph i">contracts,</em> as used in this Agreement, means the contract cited in this paragraph and all other contracts and purchase orders, including any and all amendments and modifications made between the Government and the Transferor before the effective date of this Agreement (whether or not performance and payment have been completed and releases executed if the Government or the Transferor has any remaining rights, duties, or obligations under these contracts and purchase orders).
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) As of __________________________ 19____ (insert date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law), the Transferor has transferred to the Transferee all the assets of the Transferor, or the entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of a(an) (<em class="ph i">insert term describing the legal transaction involved</em>) between the Transferor and the Transferee.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor, or the entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1).

                                 <p class="p List2">(5) The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations that may exist under the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) It is consistent with the Government's interest to recognize the Transferee as the successor party to the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(7) Evidence of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1) has been filed with the Government.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Transferor confirms the transfer to the Transferee, and waives any claims and rights against the Government or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund that it now has or may have in the future in connection with the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform the contract in accordance with the conditions contained in the contract. The Transferee also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all claims against, the Transferor pertinent to the contract, as determined by OPM, as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the Transferor with respect to the contract, with the same force and effect as if the action had been taken by the Transferee.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor's successor in interest in and to the contract. The Transferee by this Agreement becomes entitled to all rights, titles, and interests of the Transferor in and to the contract as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract. Following the effective date of this Agreement, the terms <em class="ph i">Carrier</em> and <em class="ph i">Contractor</em> as used in the contract, shall refer to the Transferee.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in it shall be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Government against the Transferor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) All payments and reimbursements previously made by the Government to the Transferor, and all other previous actions taken by the Government under the contract, shall be considered to have discharged those parts of the Government's obligations under the contract. All payments and reimbursements made by the Government after the date of this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall have the same force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and shall constitute a complete discharge of the Government's obligations under the contract, to the extent of the amounts paid or reimbursed.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(7) The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer of this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(8) The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the performance of all obligations that the Transferee 
				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			assumes under this Agreement or (ii) may undertake in the future should this contract be modified under its terms and conditions. The Transferor waives notice of, and consents to, any such future modifications.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(9) The contract shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement effective (<em class="ph i">insert the date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law</em>).
