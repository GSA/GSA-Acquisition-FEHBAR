         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			If the covered individual seeks further review of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM to review the Carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's notice to the covered individual that the denial was affirmed; or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) If the Carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, within 120 days after the date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by the Carrier; or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Within 120 days after the date the Carrier requests additional information from the covered individual, or the date the covered individual is notified that the Carrier is requesting additional information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for OPM review within the time limit. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) In reviewing a claim denied by the Carrier, OPM may:

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) When OPM requests information from the Carrier, the Carrier must release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its request. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will either: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and the Carrier; or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, OPM may make its decision based solely on information available to it at that time and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and to the Carrier. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives evidence that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB claims under authority of Federal statute (chapter 89, title 5, United States Code). A covered individual may seek judicial review of OPM's final action on the denial of a health benefits claim. A legal action to review final action by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must be brought against OPM and not against the Carrier or the Carrier's subcontractors. The recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court order directing OPM to require the Carrier to pay the amount of benefits in dispute. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) An action under paragraph (3) of this clause to recover on a claim for health benefits:

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it rendered its decision affirming the Carrier's denial of benefits.</p>

         <p class="p P">As prescribed by 1604.7202, the contracting officer will insert the following clause in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis (experience-rated):
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Large Provider Agreements (OCT 2005)
</p>

				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The experience-rated Carrier must provide notice to the contracting officer of its intent to enter into or to make a significant modification of a Large Provider Agreement:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider Agreement; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising a renewal or other option, or significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement, when such action would result in total costs to the FEHB Program of an additional 20 percent or more above the existing contract. However, if a carrier is exercising a simple renewal or other option contemplated by a Large Provider Agreement that OPM previously reviewed, and there are no significant changes, then a statement to the effect that the renewal or other option is being exercised along with the dollar amount is sufficient notice.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in writing and must, at a minimum:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider agreement will require;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the carrier selected the proposed provider, and what contracting method it used, where applicable, including the kind of competition obtained;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the provider's profit; and,
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) Describe provider risk provisions.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Contracting officer may request from the carrier any additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms and conditions prior to a provider award and during the performance of the agreement.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the Contracting officer will give the carrier either written comments or written notice that there will be no comments. If the Contracting officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar days, and explain how it intends to address any concerns.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) When computing the carrier's service charge, the Contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) The Contracting officer's review of any Large Provider Agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a determination of the acceptability of the terms and conditions of any provider agreement or of the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Records and Inspection.</em> The carrier must insert in all Large Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement that support the annual statement of operations and enrollee records—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Audit and Records—Negotiation.</em> The provisions of FAR 52.215–2, “Audit and Records—Negotiation,” when required, or FEHBAR 1652.246–70, “FEHB Inspection” apply to all experience-rated Carriers' Large Provider Agreements. The Carrier will insert the clauses at FAR 52.215–2, when applicable, or FEHBAR 1652.246–70 in all Large Provider Agreements. In FAR 52.215–2 the carrier will substitute:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The term “Large Provider” for the term “Contractor” throughout the clause, and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The term “Large Provider Agreement” for the term “Subcontracts” in paragraph (g) of FAR 52.215–2. The term “Contracting officer” will mean the FEHB Program Contracting officer at OPM. The carrier will be responsible for ensuring the Large Provider complies with the provisions set forth in the clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Prohibited Agreements.</em> No provider agreement made under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) The carrier will insert this clause, 1652.204–74, in all Large Provider Agreements.</p>

                                 <p class="p List1">(a) If any rate established in connection with this contract was increased because:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, or current as certified in one of the Certificates of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data (FEHBAR 1615.406–2);
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not accurate as represented in the rate reconciliation documents or MLR Calculation;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The Carrier developed FEHBP rates for traditional community rated plans with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates for a similarly sized subscriber group (see FEHBAR 1602.170–13) as certified in the Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community Rated Carriers;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) The Carrier, who is not mandated by the State to use traditional community rating, developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with its State-filed rating methodology (or if not required to file with the State, their standard written and established rating methodology) or inconsistent with the FEHB specific medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements (see FEHBAR 1602.170–13); or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) The Carrier submitted or, kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, data or information of any description that were not complete, accurate, and current—then, the rate shall be reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data or information.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) The Carrier was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted or maintained and identified. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the Carrier took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the Contracting Officer. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) The Carrier did not submit or keep in its files a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.

				</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) 
			Except as prohibited by subdivision (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a contract price reduction if— 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) The Carrier certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the best of the Carrier's knowledge and belief, the Carrier is entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) The Carrier proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) An offset shall not be allowed if— 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) The understated data was known by the Carrier to be understated when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on price.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) When the Contracting Officer determines that the rates shall be reduced and the Government is thereby entitled to a refund or that the Government is entitled to a MLR penalty, the Carrier shall be liable to and shall pay the FEHB Fund at the time the overpayment is repaid or at the time the MLR penalty is paid—
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Simple interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date the overpayment was paid from the FEHB Fund to the Carrier until the date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used;
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) A penalty equal to the amount of overpayment, if the Carrier knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which was incomplete, inaccurate, or noncurrent; and,
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Simple interest on the MLR penalty from the date on which the penalty should have been paid to the FEHB Fund to the date on which the penalty was or will be actually paid to the FEHB fund.

The subscription rates shall be determined according to the carrier's established policy, which must be applied consistently to the FEHBP and to the carrier's SSSG. If the SSSG receives a rate lower than that determined according to the carrier's established policy, it is considered a discount.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by reducing the FEHB rates for the next contract term to reflect the difference between the estimated rates and the rates which are derived using the methodology of the SSSG, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the FEHBP that are not given to the SSSG. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Carrier shall furnish to OPM an accounting of its operations under the contract. In preparing the accounting, the Carrier shall follow the reporting requirements and statement formats prescribed by OPM in the OPM Annual and Fiscal Year Financial Reporting Instructions. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Carrier shall have its Annual Accounting Statements and that of its underwriter, if any, audited in accordance with the FEHBP Experienced-Rated Carrier and Service Organization Audit Guide (Guide).

</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) on request, document and make available accounting support for the cost to justify that the cost is actual, reasonable and necessary; and

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, the Carrier shall classify contract costs in accordance with the following criteria: 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Benefits.</em> Benefit costs consist of payments made and liabilities incurred for covered health care services on behalf of FEHBP subscribers less any refunds, rebates, allowances or other credits received. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Administrative expenses.</em> Administrative expenses consist of all actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable expenses incurred in the adjudication of subscriber benefit claims or incurred in the Carrier's overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise stated in the contract, administrative expenses include, in part: all taxes (excluding premium taxes, as provided in section 1631.205–41), insurance and reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in the adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review when not billed by a health care provider and other forms of utilization review, the cost of maintaining eligibility files, legal expenses incurred in the litigation of benefit payments and bank charges for letters of credit. Administrative expenses exclude the cost of Carrier personnel, equipment, and facilities directly used in the delivery of health care services, which are benefit costs, and the expense of managing the FEHBP investment program which is a reduction of investment income earned. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">Investment income.</em> While compliance with the checks presented letter of credit methodology will minimize funds on hand, the Carrier shall invest and reinvest all funds on hand, including any in the Special Reserve or any attributable to the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, which are in excess of the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Investment income represents the net amount earned by the Carrier after deducting investment expenses. Investment expenses are those actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable contract costs that are attributable to the investment of funds, such as consultant or management fees. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">Other charges.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) 
			<em class="ph i">Mandatory statutory reserve.</em> Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowable unless specifically provided for in the contract. When the term “mandatory statutory reserve” is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement imposed by State law upon the Carrier to set aside a specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the Carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds become available for the general use of the Carrier, the Carrier shall return to the FEHBP a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total Carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201–5. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List4">(B) Premium taxes. 
				</p>
         <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) 
			When the term “premium taxes” is used in this contract without further definition or explanation, it means a tax, fee, or other monetary payment directly or indirectly imposed on FEHB premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those entities, with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List5">(2) For purposes of this paragraph (B), OPM has determined that the term “State” as used in 5 U.S.C. 8909(f) includes, but is not limited to, a territory or possession of the United States. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy.</em> 
				     </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Carrier shall certify the annual and fiscal year accounting statements in the form set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Carrier's chief executive officer and the chief financial officer shall sign the certificate. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Carrier shall require an authorized agent of its underwriter, if any, also to certify the annual accounting statement. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) The certificate required shall be in the following form:

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) To the extent that this contract provides for performing services outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes clause of the contract.

</p>
                                 <p class="p P">“Tax” and “taxes,” as used in this clause, include fees and charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the country concerned or by its political subdivisions.

                                 <p class="p P">“All applicable taxes and duties,” as used in this clause, means all taxes and duties, in effect on the contract date, that the taxing authority is imposing and collecting on the transactions covered by this contract, pursuant to written ruling or regulation in effect on the contract date. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">“After-imposed tax,” as used in this clause, means any new or increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the contract date but whose exemption was later revoked or reduced during the contract period, other than excepted tax, on the transactions covered by this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p P">“After-relieved tax,” as used in this clause, means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions covered by this contract, but which the Carrier is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Carrier obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.

                                 <p class="p List1">(d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Carrier states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty.

                                 <p class="p List1">(g) No adjustment shall be made in the contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds $250. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) If the Carrier obtains a reduction in tax liability under the United States Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code) because of the payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the United States as the Contracting Officer directs. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) The Carrier shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, from which the United States Government, the Carrier, any subcontractor, or the transactions covered by this contract are exempt under the laws of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the governments of the United States and of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(j) The Carrier shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all matters relating to taxes or duties that reasonably may be expected to result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price and shall take appropriate action as the Contracting Officer directs. The contract price shall be equitably adjusted to cover the costs of action taken by the Carrier at the direction of the Contracting Officer, including any interest, penalty, and reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty in the performance aspect of the carrier's service charge. In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall add the total cost/price for the base year and all options, including quantity or service options and option periods.

The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act. All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215–2 “Audit and Records—Negotiations” if based on cost analysis or 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1552.246–70 “FEHB Inspection” if based on price analysis.

			The Government shall deliver to the Carrier, for use in connection with and under the terms of this contract, the Government-furnished property described in this contract together with any related data and information that the Carrier may request and is reasonably required for the intended use of the property (hereinafter referred to as “Government-furnished property”). 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use (except for property furnished “as-is”) will be delivered to the Carrier at the times stated in this contract or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the Carrier to meet the contract's performance dates.

                                 <p class="p List2">(3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the Government is responsible. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Final accounting and disposition of Government property.</em> Upon completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall submit, in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all items of Government property (including any resulting scrap) not consumed in performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The Carrier shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the contract price or shall be paid to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs.

                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The Carrier shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (c), (e), or (i) of this clause, except that if the Carrier failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (c) or (i), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) In arriving at the amount due the Carrier under this clause, there shall be deducted—

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(i) If the termination is partial, the Carrier may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract.

                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(a) 
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of default to the Carrier, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Carrier fails to— 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Perform the services within the time specified in this contract or any extension; 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below). 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or service similar to those terminated, and the Carrier will be liable to the Government for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Carrier shall continue the work not terminated. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier. Examples of such causes include 
				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the control of both the Carrier and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for the Carrier to meet the required delivery schedule. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may require the Carrier to transfer title and deliver to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed or partially completed information and contract rights that the Carrier has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) If, after termination, it is determined that the Carrier was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government. 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
